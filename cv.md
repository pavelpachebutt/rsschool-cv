### About me:

I got interested in website development relatively recently. I wanted to radically change my profession. I stumbled across the RS School courses on the Internet and decided to try it. And I was overwhelmed.

Studying is not easy, but it is very exciting, so I want to continue to draw new knowledge and improve my level!

        let rightSum = arr.slice(i + 1).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
        if (leftSum === rightSum) {
